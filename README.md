# Getting Back
since it's been a long time since the last real frontend project for me I thought start with this project which will contains all of the cool feature like Next.js, GSAP and Three.js to make it modern as apple web page.

## Installing
I install the next.js application and removed all the unnecessary pieces and we're running right now Hooray!
