# Getting Back
since it's been a long time since the last real frontend project for me I thought start with this project which will contains all of the cool feature like Next.js, GSAP and Three.js to make it modern as apple web page.


## Installing
I install the next.js application and removed all the unnecessary pieces and we're running right now Hooray!

## Adding my Valuable Assets
So, let's start clean so I added all of the images and vidoes I will need and also added the font looks neat.

## Adding Stylish Navbar
Since this is the first thing you glince on it in any web page so started with making one stylish and kinda simple.

## Dark and Light toggle
Thought it would be cool to add a toggle button under the logo just to product my eyes and also i've made a component checks first if the user scheme dark or light.

## Implement Hero Section
So, it's time for working so started with the Hero section it's the first thing the user will find so added a cute video and make it the width for the whole screen to make it as something out of the page.
